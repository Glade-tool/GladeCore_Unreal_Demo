# GladeCore Unreal Demo

A packaged demo showcasing the **GladeCore** Unreal Engine plugin for local, on-device NPC dialogue with TTS/STT.

---

## What’s Inside
- **Local LLM** driving NPC dialogue (no cloud required)
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** via local **Piper** voices (optional **ElevenLabs** support)
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)** using your default microphone

---

## Quick Start (Test Drive)

3. **Find an NPC & Interact**
